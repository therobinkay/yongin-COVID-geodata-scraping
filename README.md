# yongin-COVID-geodata-scraping
A data scraping template for the COVID case location data from Yongin, South Korea. Yongin City Hall officially discontinued its services to provide the users the detailed location tracking of the COVID cases on September 2020, but the programmed code was applicable until the service discontinued. Further works can be attempted to modify the codes to target other cities or counties that provide a full-on data on COVID case tracking.
